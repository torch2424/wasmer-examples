WebAssembly is already available from Javascript for both the browser and the server \(Node.js\) ðŸ¤—

In this case, Wasmer provides a lot of useful packages that allow easy interaction between WebAssembly modules and Javascript.

In this section we will see how to setup both your server-side and browser environments to use WebAssembly, and also how to use WebAssembly modules that interact with the Operating System such as [WASI](wasi/) using the different packages that Wasmer offer for Javascript.

## Published NPM Packages

Wasmer publishes various packages to NPM:

* [`@wasmer/wasi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wasmer/wasi): The Package for using WASI easily from Node and the Browser
* [`@wasmer/wasm-transformer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wasmer/wasm-transformer): Allows you to run WebAssembly modules in browsers that don't yet have Wasm `BigInt` support
